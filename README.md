Moi! 👋

I am **Yogesh Verma**, a doctoral researcher in machine learning at Aalto University, Finland. Before my Ph.D. in machine learning, I studied bachelor's and master's in physics. I like to think about things at the intersection of physics, machine learning, and its application in the sciences.
